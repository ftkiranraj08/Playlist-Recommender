## Chi-Square Test of Independence: Playlist Type vs. Track Genre

In this project, we first performed a Chi-Square Test of Independence on all the playlists to examine the relationship between playlist type (e.g., workout, chill, motivation) and track genre. The goal was to determine if certain playlist types are more likely to contain specific genres, for example, if workout playlist contains a lot of hip-hop or chill playlist contains a lot of lofi songs, thus providing valuable insights for improving playlist recommendation systems.

## Hypotheses:

**Null Hypothesis (H0):** Playlist type and track genre are independent. In other words, the typer of playlist has no effect on the genres of tracks it contains.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Playlist type and track genre are dependent. This means that the type of playlist is associated with the genres of tracks it contains.

## Test Procedure:

1. Contingency Table: A table was created with playlist types as rows and track genres as columns, showing the frequency of each genre within each playlist type.
2. Chi-Square Calculation: We calculated the Chi-Square statistic to compare observed frequencies with expected frequencies under the assumption of independence.
3. Hypothesis Testing: A p-value was obtained to test the null hypothesis. If the p-value was less than 0.05, we rejected the null hypothesis and concluded that playlist type and track genre are dependent.

## Results:

**Test Statistic (X-squared):** 9616.6
 
**Degrees of Freedom (df):** 240

**p-value:** < 2.2e-16

The p-value of less than 2.2e-16 is extremely small, indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis. As a result, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that playlist type and track genre are statistically significantly associated. This means that certain types of playlists (e.g., workout, chill) are more likely to feature specific genres, suggesting a dependency between playlist type and genre.

## Conclusion:

The results of the Chi-Square Test of Independence provide compelling evidence that playlist types influence the genres of tracks they contain. This insight can be used to improve playlist recommendation systems by incorporating genre preferences based on the type of playlist a user is interested in.

## Chi-Square Test of Independence: Comparing User Playlist Genre Distribution vs. Recommendation Candidate

Building on the insight that certain playlist types are more likely to contain specific genres, we further applied this understanding to assess whether a given recommendation candidate aligns with a userâ€™s playlist genre preferences. The approach involved comparing the track genre distribution of a userâ€™s playlists to that of a recommendation candidate using the Chi-Square Test of Independence.

## Hypotheses:
**Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no significant difference between the genre distribution of the userâ€™s playlists and the recommendation candidate. This means the recommendation candidate is similar to the userâ€™s playlists in terms of genre distribution.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is a significant difference between the genre distribution of the userâ€™s playlists and the recommendation candidate. This suggests the recommendation candidate does not align well with the userâ€™s playlist genre preferences.

## Test Procedure:

1. **Genre Distribution Comparison:** We calculated the genre distribution of the userâ€™s playlists and the recommendation candidate. A contingency table was created to represent the frequency of each genre within both the userâ€™s playlists and the recommendation candidate.

2. **Chi-Square Calculation:** The Chi-Square statistic was calculated to compare the genre distributions. If the observed and expected distributions were significantly different, this would indicate a mismatch between the userâ€™s preferences and the recommendation candidate.

3. **Hypothesis Testing:** A p-value was obtained to test the null hypothesis. If the p-value was less than 0.05, we rejected the null hypothesis, meaning the recommendation candidate did not align with the userâ€™s playlist genre preferences, and thus would not be recommended.

## Results:

Based on the Chi-Square Test results, if the p-value was greater than 0.05, we would fail to reject the null hypothesis and recommend the playlist (H0), indicating that the genre distribution of the recommendation candidate is in alignment with the userâ€™s preferences. On the other hand, if the p-value was less than 0.05, we would reject the null hypothesis (H1) and not recommend the playlist, as it would indicate a mismatch in genre distribution.

## Conclusion:
By comparing the genre distribution of the userâ€™s playlists with that of the recommendation candidate using the Chi-Square Test, we could assess whether the candidate aligns with the userâ€™s musical preferences. This statistical approach helps refine the recommendation process by ensuring that the suggested playlists match the genre preferences of the user, leading to more personalized and relevant recommendations.

**Conclusion of Project:**

We performed descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze whether certain features like track energy, tempo, track genre affect the creation of the playlist. We also performed non-parametric tests to see if a playlist can be recommended based on userâ€™s favorite playlists.
