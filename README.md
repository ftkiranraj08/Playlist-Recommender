# **Optimizing Playlist Recommendations**  
### *A Statistical and Non-Parametric Analysis of Track Popularity, Genre Diversity, and Playlist Structure*  

## **Overview**  
In todayâ€™s digital era, recommender systems play a crucial role in personalizing user experiences. This project explores the effectiveness of playlist recommendations on **Spotify** by analyzing the **Spotify Million Playlist Dataset (MPD)**. By identifying key patterns in **track popularity, genre diversity, and playlist structure**, we aim to enhance understanding of user preferences and improve recommendation models.  

## **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to conduct a **statistical and non-parametric analysis** of Spotify playlists to:  
- Identify the factors influencing **playlist engagement** and effectiveness.  
- Examine **genre distribution, track repetition, and sequence patterns**.  
- Provide insights that can improve playlist recommendation algorithms.  

## **Dataset**  
We use the **Spotify Million Playlist Dataset (MPD)**, which consists of over **one million user-generated playlists**, containing **track metadata, playlist descriptions, and user interactions**.  

## **Methodology**  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and structuring the dataset for analysis.  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Exploring track popularity, genre trends, and user preferences.  
- **Non-Parametric Tests:** Identifying patterns without assuming normal distributions.  
- **Visualization:** Using **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly** for interactive insights.  
- **Machine Learning:** Implementing clustering and recommendation models.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries & Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Data Visualization:** Plotly, Tableau (optional)  
- **Machine Learning:** Collaborative Filtering, Clustering  

## **Expected Outcomes**  
- A deeper understanding of how **users curate playlists**.  
- Insights to optimize **music recommender systems**.  
- Data-driven recommendations to improve **playlist engagement** and user experience.
